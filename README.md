# Flacdisc-website-
A flacdisc selling website made using bootstrap, HTML and JS

This page is the Landing page or the first index page of the website

The below list in the Navbar is just there for the structure ,i still haven't written functional usage code for it
Home
Albums
Flac-CDs

search bar
except Sign in button ,which works as to go to sign in or login page


Also in the HEADER part SHOP NOW button is not for functional coded just for the structure 

Buttons:
ADD NOW - used "modal class" or property from bootstrap for confirmation only
BUY NOW - used for navigating to the detailed page and description about the product

The pagination "(prev/1/2/3/next)"
the pagination property from bootstrap is functional and given at  both Top and Bottom of the products pages

NAV TAB
this property from bootstrap is used for the "OUR PROMISES" part of the page

Frequently Asked Questions-"ACCORDION"
accordion class property from bootstrap is used for FAQs part of the page which contains also "collapse" property 

the productspageno2.html is functional ,each products has their own description pages in both landing page and this page
 
but
as said previously ,this "productspageno3.html" third page of products was created only for the sole purpose of showing the usage of Pagination property from bootstrap which is used for navigating from one page to another page easier

so in this page, all the products will have similar product description pages when clicked BUY NOW button
